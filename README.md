- The MAX1365/MAX1367 low-power, 4.5- and 3.5-digit,panel meters feature an integrated sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (ADC), LED display drivers, voltagedigital-to-analog converter (DAC), and a 4–20mA(or 0 to 16mA) current driver.The MAX1365/MAX1367’s analog input voltage range isprogrammable to either ±2V or ±200mV. The MAX1367drives a 3.5-digit (±1999 count) display and theMAX1365 drives a 4.5-digit (±19,999 count) display.The ADC output directly drives the LED display as wellas the voltage DAC, which in turn drives the 4–20mA(or 0 to 16mA) current-loop output.
